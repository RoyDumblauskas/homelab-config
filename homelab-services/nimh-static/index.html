  <h1>Ninjas In My Head</h1>
  <h4>By: Roy Dumblauskas</h4>

  <h3>Chapter 1</h3>
  <p>
    I knew I messed up the moment I opened my eyes; The ninjas are here. One on the telephone wire, another riding a
    motorcycle, and the final one making more noise than he should from the roof of the bus. I glance around. Easy
    targets galore. These kids won't know what hit them. I sink further into my seat, scanning around me one more time
    just to be sure no one is looking before slipping on my hood. It's cool, understated even. The cowl dips just low
    enough to hide the top half of my face, leaving only my mouth and chin exposed. The corner of my lips rise into a
    smirk; It's game time.

    Before anyone notices, I slip out the window. I move quick. The element of surprise is my greatest advantage here.
    My first strike is decisive. A katana flies from my hands. It threads the needle through the spokes of the
    motorcycle's front wheel. In the next instant, the rider is catapulted forward over the handlebars. Even as my feet
    land on the roof of the car next to the bus, I'm making my next move. A ball of electricity gathers in my hands
    before shooting in a lightning bolt like arc towards the first ninja on the wires. His inhuman pace may allow him to
    match the bus, but it's useless before my magic. Like a cartoon bird on a wire, his skeleton lights up from the
    inside, and he starts to fall. Unfortunately for me, the last ninja now has time to react. He has the high ground,
    but it doesn't matter. He leaps into a front flip, his sai extending in my direction. Deadly tools in the right
    hands, and unluckily for him, they won't be in his much longer. As his right hand passes by I duck to the side while
    grabbing his wrist. Then I extend my right hand to his chest and move my left foot in a semicircle, transferring his
    moment through me while turning him around. His back slams into the roof of the car, and as it does, I collapse my
    right elbow with all the momentum of the leap, striking my forearm into his throat. The impact releases his grip on
    the weapon, and my left hand releases his wrist to catch it as it falls. I continue its motion, driving the sai down
    towards his stomach, and as it goes towards his heart, he, just like the motorcycle and two ninjas before, burst
    into a cloud of black smoke.

    A frown is visible beneath my cowl as I stand up on the roof of the car. Sai in hand, I quickly jump back into the
    bus, and remove my cowl.

    The ninjas have been getting more and more audacious lately. Three operatives to take out a group of kids is
    overkill, and they shouldn't know that I'm here; I've remained perfectly undercover. I suppose all the missing
    ninjas have alerted them to something going wrong. I'll need to be even more careful not to let on go in the future.
    These shadowy creatures work for purposes beyond my understanding. The only thing I can do is get stronger and
    continue protecting the school bus from their advances.

    As I'm pondering this dilemma, the bus has arrived at the school. I look up and groan. It's going to be another long
    day ahead.

    "Oi, Jamie, come on!" Shouts a young kid with brown hair and browner eyes. Spencer.

    I roll my eyes, "I'm comin' man, just wait a sec." Spencer is a good kid. He's not the brightest, but he's nice, and
    I like that. Also he talks to me, which gets him bonus points. "Also, I told you I want to go by 'Jameson' now. It's
    my real name anyway."

    "ehhhhhh, isn't that a bit too long? I like Jamie!"

    I roll my eyes, "Ugh, fine. You're so difficult."

    "Why do you keep rolling your eyes so much?"

    I roll my...

    I blush, "None of your business! It's just something more mature people do!" At least I see my parents do it a lot.
    I don't expect Spencer to understand the nuances of a hero like me. If I could tell him about the ninjas he'd be so
    jealous.

    "Hey, Spencer, did you know I've beat up a ninja before?"

    "Uhmmmm, duh. Hasn't everybody? They're always, like, the weakest ones in video games."

    I'm aghast. Ninjas? Weak? He must be taught before he gets hurt.

    While we're talking, Spencer and I make it just in time for class.

    "I don't know Jamie" insists Spencer as we walk through the door, "Ninjas don't even have magic. How can they match
    up against a mage?"

    I open my mouth to refute, but Mrs. Kristal interrupts, "Jamie, Spencer. Sit down. We're about to start. You can
    have your discussion after class."

    I want to talk back, but my mom would probably get mad at me if she heard about it, so I hold my tongue. Spencer
    isn't so smart, "But Mrs. Kristal, Jamie thinks that ninjas are strong, when they're not even."

    I blush hard, but Mrs. Kristal just chuckles, "Well aren't they? They can be very sneaky, which is a strength too.
    Be careful or they might just sneak up on you!"

    Spencer's head droops as he contemplates, "Sure, I guess they are!" Then he turns to me and says, "Jamie, why didn't
    you mention that?"

    WHAT? Of course they're sneaky. That's their whole thing. Why would I even need to mention that?!

    "Now now, save it for later. Sit down." As I walk past Mrs. Kristal's desk, she speaks up again, "Jamie, what's that
    in your bag?"

    "What," I say, confused. I loop my bag around to the front to get a better look, and I'm horrified. Poking out the
    top of my bag is the sai, undissolved even after I took care of the ninjas on the bus ride this morning.
